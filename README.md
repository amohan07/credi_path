```

3. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

4. Install frontend dependencies:

## Environment Variables

Create the following files before running the project.

### Backend (`backend/.env.example`)
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### Frontend (`frontend/.env.example`)
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. Start the frontend application:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and visit:

## Admin Access

Admins are **not publicly registered**.

To create an admin:
1. Register a normal user
2. Update the user's role in MongoDB:
```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```

This approach follows real-world security best practices.
